# Deploy a CRA project to Vercel

In this example, a deployment of a regular CRA project is made to Vercel using Github secrets as env vars. Rather than using Vercel's auto-deployment feature to create a deployment for each commit to the main branch, this strategy uses GitHub Actions and Vercel CLI to deploy on whatever [event that trigger a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

### Get started

1. Create a vercel.json file at the root of your project folder to add [Git configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration/git-configuration#). Set `git.deploymentEnabled` to false which will prevent auto-deployments from commits..
2. Then, letâ€™s add the required values from Vercel as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in GitHub
3. On your local computer or development environment, install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel login`
4. Inside your project folder, run `vercel link` to create a new Vercel project or link to an existing one
5. Navigate to the generated `.vercel` folder, and open project.json to find the `projectID` and `orgId`
6. In GitHub, set `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to your `projectID` and `VERCEL_ORG_ID` to your `orgID`
7. Retrieve your [Vercel Access Token](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token) and set it as the value of `VERCEL_TOKEN`
8. Define a Github Action to kick off a deployment based on one of these [examples](https://github.com/danilobjr/vercel-gha/tree/main/.github/workflows)
